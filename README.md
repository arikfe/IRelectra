Electra A/C IR Encoder for IRremote

The project can be used to control Electra A/C that are common is Israel.
It doesn't has all the features that exist in the original remote, but only a subset.
You can control:
1. Whether to turn the A/C ON or OFF (A bit tricky).
2. A/C mode: cool, heat, dry, fan or auto.
3. Fan speed: low, medium, high or auto.
4. Swing: on/off
5. Sleep mode: on/off (raise temperature by one degree every 3 hours, turn off A/C after 8 hours)

Other features like timers or "I feel" are not supported.

IRelectra uses IRremote to do the heavy lifting.

Usage:

```cpp
#include "IRremote.h"
#include "IRelectra.h"
  
void loop()
  IRsend irsend(D3);
  IRelectra e(&irsend);
  e.SendElectra(POWER_OFF, MODE_COOL, FAN_LOW, 24, SWING_ON, SLEEP_OFF);
}
```
